  ' Cumberland ！' she repeated the word tenderly. ' Ah ！ I wish I wasgoing there too. I was once happy in Cumberland. 'I tried again to lift the veil that hung between this woman and me.' Perhaps you were born,' I said, ' in the beautiful Lake country. '' No,' she answered. ' I was born in Hampshire; but I once went toschool for a little while in Gumberland. Lakes？ I don't remember anylakes. It's Limmeridge village, and Limmeridge House, I should like to seeagaiI1. 'It was my turn now to stop suddenly. In the excited state of my curi-osity, at that moment, the chance reference to Mr Fairlie's place of resi-dence, on the lips of my strange companion, staggered me with astonish-ment.'Did you hear anybody calling after us？' she asked, looking up anddown the road afffightedly, the instant I stopped.'No, no. I was only struck by the name of Limmeridge House. Iheard it mentioned by some Cumberland people a few days since. 'Ah！ not my people. Mrs Fairlie is dead; and her husband is dead;and their litde girl may be married and gone away by this time. I can't saywho lives at Limmeridge now. If any more are left there of that name, Ionly know I love them for Mrs Fairlie's sake. 'She seemed about to say more; but while she was speaking, we camewithin view of the turnpike, at the top of the Avenue Road. Her handtightened round my arm, and she looked anxiously at the gate before us.'Is the turnpike man looking out？' she asked.He was not looking out; no one else was near the place when we pas-sed through the gate. The sight of the gas-lamps and houses seemed to agi-tate her, and to make her impatient.' This is London,' she said. ' Do you see any carriage I can get？ I amtired and frightened. I want to shut myself in and be driven away. 'I explained to her that we must walk a little further to get to a cab-stand, unless we were fortunate enough to meet with an empty vehicle; andthen tried to resume the subject of Cumberland. It was useless. That ideaof shutting herself in, and being driven away, had now got full possessionof her mind. She could think and talk of nothing else.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
《白衣女人》的故事情节环环相扣，悬念的设置让人读来欲罢不能。柯林斯设置了险象环生的神秘悬念，刻画了栩栩如生、入木三分的人物形象，独创了前所未有的叙述方式，使读者读起来好似在法院现场参加一个案件的审理，听着当事人一个接一个地出来作证，他们各自用自己的口吻、从自己的角度叙述本人的一段经历，故事一段一段地呈现出来，*终拼凑成一个完整的、扣人心弦的故事。小说多次被改编成影视剧和音乐剧，柯林斯也被推崇为侦探小说的先驱，其影响可见一斑。
