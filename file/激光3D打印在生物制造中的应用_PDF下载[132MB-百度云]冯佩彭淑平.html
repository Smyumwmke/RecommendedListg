As the world's most populous country， China has entered the aging society since the end of the 20th century， and is expected to supplant Japan as the world's most aging country in 2030. The aged is a highrisk and vulnerable population of serious diseases and accidental injuries because of the decline of physiological function， weak control over environment and the phenomenon of "empty nest". As a result， trssue/organ defects are growing rapidly and there has been an ever-increasing demand for biomedical implants. In order to repair the defective tissues/organs， a biomedical implant should not only mimic the material characteristics and gradient structure of the defective sites， but also have sufficient mechanical properties to support cells and withstand complex stresses inthe physiological environment. Meanwhile， the implant should possess controllable degradation rate and favorable osteoinductivity. These complex structures， harsh performance and individual differences put forward great challenges for the fabrication methods of biomedical implants. So far， biomedical implants are fabricated mainly by forging， casting and machining， which requires not only complex molds but also high cost for single-piece production. More importantly， traditional fabrication methods are difficult to obtain the gradient structure and performance of implants. Therefore， it has become a huge challenge to manufacture personalized biomedical implants for the repair and regeneration of defective tissues/organs.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
