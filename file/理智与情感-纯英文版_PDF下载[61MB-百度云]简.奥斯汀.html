Although she loved her home dearly， she was anxious to leave， as Mrs. John Dashwood was quite disagreeable to her. The mother and three daughters decided that they must find a home near Norland， as leaving it would be unthinkable. They had looked at several homes nearby， but Elinor had rejected them， as they were too expensive for their small income.　　Before his death， Mrs. Dashwood's husband had informed her of his son's promise to take care of her and her three daughters. She trusted that his promise was true， and was content that her daughters would not have to worry about income. She felt guilty for previously not trusting him to be a generous individual， but now believed he would， indeed， help them.　　Mrs. Dashwood had never liked the younger Mrs. John Dashwood， and never trusted the young woman. Since the young couple and their child had moved into Norland， the mother's feelings towards her daughter-in-law had become worse. Mrs. Dashwood wished to leave Norland after a short time， but Elinor explained that they first must find a suitable home. During their time at Norland， Elinor became quite close to the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood， Edward Ferrars， a pleasing young man， who often came for visits after Mrs. John Dashwood and her husband moved to Norland.　　Some mothers might encourage their child to marry for wealth or for fame， but Mrs. Dashwood believed Edward Ferrars to be friendly， and in love with her daughter. Therefore， Mrs. Dashwood was quite content that her daughter begin a relationship with the agreeable young man， who was also quite wealthy.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　文坛曾发生过多次趣味革命，读者口味不断翻新，影响了几乎所有作家的声望，唯有与莎士比亚齐名的奥斯汀经久不衰。其作品的魅力在于不涉及宏观的历史背景，所讨论的婚恋主题以及对人性的细微观察，都让我们感受到一种跨越时空的亲切感。奥斯汀所处的时代距今已远，但其作品的魅力恰恰在于它所散发的历史感和陌生感。　　《床头灯英语·3000词读物（纯英文）：理智与情感》讲述了姐姐艾莉诺和妹妹玛丽安偶遇爱情、坠入情网、横生变故、终成眷属的故事。作者以诙谐的反讽、清晰的思辨、悠长的语句，使得理智的姐姐、感性的妹妹、内心依赖的母亲、吝啬的兄嫂、八面玲珑的露西等诸多形象在读者心中逐渐丰满、立体起来。姐妹俩在遭遇人生变故、感情波折时做出的截然不同的反应，特别能牵动读者的心弦。*后姐姐一步步领妹妹走出感情阴霾，通往自立和豁达。同时，《床头灯英语·3000词读物（纯英文）：理智与情感》也让读者从中领悟到了非凡的生活智慧。　　在现实生活中，奥斯汀本人一生未嫁，而是投身于写作中，并获得了“在两寸象牙上雕刻”的美誉，甚至有人说她是“嫁给文字的女人”。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
