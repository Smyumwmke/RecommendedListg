The ability to master and apply computer technology has become one of the criten.a to measure the quality of a professional technicians. Assembly Language &amp; Interfaang Technology is an important computer technology course in science and engineering of higher education.　　Although the rapid development of computer technology， microprocessors have been from 32 to 64-bit transition， for a variety of control systems， we commonly use 8-bit， 16-bit interface technology to meet the appli.cation requirements， so 32 or even 64 microprocessor to explain the working principle of microcomputers is not suitable. This book is a 16-bit microprocessor model， about the basic principles of computer and interface technology， easy to learn and understand， its basic concepts， basic ideas and basic methods and 32-bit processor are the same.　　This book is mainly for the general colleges and universities of computer science， electromechanical contror and non-electronics majors students. The preparation of this book focuses on theory with practice and engineering applications. In the preparation of teaching materials in the introduction oflife ，a lot of examples witch are easy to understand are used to help readers understand the basic concepts of computer. After talking about the working pri.nciple of various interface chips， the book g：ives a number of examples which can be directly applied， and give some different solutions to achieve the function.　　The book is divided into 7 chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the basics of comicrocomprter systems； Chapter 2 introduces assembly language in graphical form； Chapter 3 introduces the assembly language programming method； Chapter 4 introduces the 16-bit processor Pins， read and write timing； Chapter 5 describes the I/O interface， the basic composition， read and write technology and data transfer； Chapter 6 introduces the concept of interrupts and functions of programming 8259A chip. Chapter 7 introduces the internal structure and programming of the programmable parallel interface chip 8255A， the serial interface chip 8251A， and the timer/counter interface chip 8253/8254.　　This book is comprehensive， and self-contained， the assembly language prograrrurung part and the computer principle and interface technology are orgamied together， through appropriate choice， and is suitable both computer professional and non-computer professional students.　　This book is writen by Zeng Lanl.ing， Han Xiaoru， and Li chang； Adjardiah Winffed Kudjo Patrick as deputy editors.　　The authors of this book in the process of writing referred to a lot of excellent reference materials， thanks to the author of these materials， in particular， thanks especially to Ma Weihua， Qian Xiajie and Yang Wenxian. In addition， the writing of this book has been the national teaching quality engineering network of professional comprehensive reform project and Jiangsu University teaching reform project support.　　Due to the limitation of editors， there are some errors and omission， please critilize.
