It is protected by the little hill.'　　‘How's everything?'　　‘Not so bad. This machine is no good but the others march.' He stopped working and smiled, 'Were you on permission?'　　‘Yes.'　　He wiped his hands on his jumper and grinned. 'You have a good time?' The others all grinned too.　　‘Fine,' I said.  'What's the matter with this machine?'　　‘It's no good. One thing after another.'　　‘What's the matter now?'　　‘New rings.'　　I left them working, the car looked disgraced and empty with the engine open and parts spread on the work bench, and went in under the shed and looked at each of the cars. They were moderately clean, a few freshly washed, the others dusty. I looked at the tires carefully,-looking for cuts or stone bnuses. Everything seemed in good condition. It evidently made no difference whether I was there to look after things or not. I had imagined that the condition of the cars, whether or not things were obtainable, the smooth functioning of the business of removing wounded and sick from the dressing stations, hauling them back from the mountains to the clearing station and then distributing them to the hospitals named on their papers, depended to a considerable extent on myself. Evidently it did not matter whether I was there or not.　　‘Has there been any trouble getting parts?' I asked the sergeant mechanic.　　‘No, Signor Tenente.'　　‘Where is the gasoline park now?'　　‘At the same place.'　　‘Good,' I said and went back to the house and drank another bowl of coffee at the mess table. The coffee was a pale gray and sweet with condensed nulk. Outside the window it was a lovely spring morning. There was that 'oeginning of a feeling of dryness in the nose that meant the day would be hot later on. That day I visited the posts in the mountains and was back in town late in the afternoon.The whole thing seemed to run better while I was away. The offensive was going to start again I heard. The division for which we worked were to attack at a place up the river and the major told me that I would see about the posts for during the attack The attack would cross the river up above the narrow gorge and spread up the hillside. The posts for the cars would have to be as near the nver as they could get and keep covered. They would of course, be selected by the infantry but we were supposed to work it out. It was one ofthose tlungs that gave you a false feeling of soldiering.　　I was very dusty and dirty and went up to my room to wash. Rinaldi was sitting on the bed with a copy of Hugo's English grammar. He was dressed, wore his black boots, and his hair shone.　　‘Splendid,' he said when he saw me. 'You will come with me to see Miss Barkley.'　　‘No.'　　‘Yes. You will please come and make me a good impression on her.'　　‘All right. Wait tilll get cleaned up.'　　‘Wash up and come as you are.'　　I washed, brushed my hair and we started.　　‘Wait a minute,' Rinaldi said. 'Perhaps we should have a drink.' He opened his trunk and took out a bottle.　　‘Not Strega,' I said.‘No. Grappa.'　　‘A11 right.'　　He poured two glasses and we touched them, first fingers extended.The grappa was very strong.　　‘Another?'　　‘All right,' I said. We drank the second grappa, Rinaldi put away the bottle and we went down the stairs. It was hot walking through the town but the sun was starting to go down and it was very pleasant. The British hospital was a big villa built by Germans before the war. Miss Barkley was in the garden. Another nurse was with her. We saw their white uniforms through the trees and walked toward them. Rinaldi saluted. I saluted too but more moderately.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《中译经典文库·世界文学名著：永别了，武器（英语原著版·第五辑）》因反对战争的鲜明主题和成熟的艺术技巧而产生了板大的影响。这部作品虽然主题是反对战争，但也是一帮爱情悲剧，作者通过亨利和凯瑟琳的不幸遭遇诅咒战争。评论界有人把小说中因战争而造成的恋爱悲剧和罗密欧与朱丽叶的爱情悲剧相提并论。这部作品问世后很快风摩全世界，被再版几十次，翻译成几十种文字发行，还被改编成剧本并拍成电影，具有极大的震撼力。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　海明威（1899～1961），生于美国芝加哥市郊橡胶园小镇，是一名美国记者和作家，他被认为是20世纪*著名的小说家之一，也被认为是美利坚民族的精神丰碑。　　海明威的《老人与海》其实改编自一个真实的故事。1935年，一个老渔民告诉海明威自己曾经捕猎到一条大马林鱼，但是后来被鲨鱼吃掉。老渔民的这段传奇经历引起了海明威的兴趣，他决定把老渔民的经历写成小说介绍给读者。　　1950年圣诞节后不久，海明威在古巴哈瓦那开始动笔写《老人与海》（起初名为《现有的海》），结果在1951年2月23日就完成了初稿，前后仅用了八周时间。1951年4月份海明威把手稿送给友人传阅，博得了一致的赞美。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
