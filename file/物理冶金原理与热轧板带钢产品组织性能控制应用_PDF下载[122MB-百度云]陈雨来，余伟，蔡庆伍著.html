陈雨来、余伟、蔡庆伍*的《物理冶金原理与热轧板带钢产品组织性能控制应用(英文版)》讲述了： The book has six 
chapters. The first chapter to the fourth chapter introduces the physi- cal 
metallurgy principle of steel strengthening and toughening mechanism, 
austenitedeformation and recrystallization, transformation of undercooled 
austenite, micro allo-ying elements dissolved and precipitated. The fifth 
chapter is the development and ap-plication of physical metallurgy method in the 
production of medium and heavyplate. The sixth chapter is the development and 
application of physical metallurgicalmethod in hot strip production. This book 
can be used as a reference book for scientific and technical personnel inrelated 
fields, and as a teaching material for college and graduate students majored 
inthe material forming and control.
