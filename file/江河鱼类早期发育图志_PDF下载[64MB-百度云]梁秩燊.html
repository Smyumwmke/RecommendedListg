本书系统介绍了近50年来搜集到的长江、珠江主要淡水鱼类早期发育材料，阐述了江河鱼类的早期发育形态、生态特征，运用在幼鱼阶段对鱼类发育阶段定种的方法进行分类，形成了100余种鱼类胚前胚后发育图谱的准确资料。
                                        </p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>国内*本纯手绘鱼类发育图志，收集近50年来长江、珠江主要淡水鱼类早期发育资料，通过点线着墨的方式，手绘出鱼类发育图。本书的资料积累工作始于20世纪60年代。由几位著名的淡水鱼类专家担任主编并成立了由中国科学院水工程生态研究所、中国科学院水生生物研究所、中国水产科学研究院珠江水产研究所、中山大学、华南师范大学、广州环境保护科学研究院、珠江水资源保护科学研究所等单位专家组成的编研团队。
《江河鱼类早期发育图志》的出版有助于研究江河水利水电枢纽建设对鱼类繁殖与鱼类生态环境造成的影响，是识别鱼类胚胎和鱼苗的必要基础资料，解决了江河鱼类早期发育研究的难题。该书的出版对江河鱼类早期发育的研究和发展、鱼类生态的保护及指导江河水利枢纽的建设具有举足轻重的作用。 </p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>梁秩燊，高级工程师，一级美术家，我国淡水鱼类胚胎发育研究专家。长期从事江河鱼类胚胎发育的研究。曾任广州市环境保护科学研究院高级工程师。发表论文 50 多篇，参编《长江鱼类》《葛洲坝水利枢纽与长江四大家鱼》等著作，并作为主要参加者获中国科学院、省级、市级、局级科技进步奖 29项。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
