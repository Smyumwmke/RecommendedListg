    编  者</p>, <p>When you were growing up. did you ever wish that your parents were happy?<br/>
Did vou feel safe when they were happy and peaceful?<br/>
     My mother was rarely a happy person. Most of the time she was anxious, angry<br/>
and felt overburdened, even though I was her only child. She rarely laughed and was<br/>
often upset with me, or my father. Clearly, she made both of us responsible for her<br/>
happiness and we consistently fell short.<br/>
     I would have given anything to have had a happy mother-a mother who knew<br/>
how to take responsibility for her own happiness and pain. I would have loved to have<br/>
had a mother who showed me how to take loving care of myself instead of showing me<br/>
how to be an unhappy martyr.<br/>
      Often, in my counseling work with parents, I ask them if their parents were<br/>
happy. Most of the time they say no. I ask them if they wanted their parents to be<br/>
happy and invariably they say, "Yes, I would have loved it." Yet these same parents<br/>
are not taking responsibility for making themselves happy now. They are acting just<br/>
like their parents -- anxious, angry, depressed, withdrawn, resistant, or compliant.<br/>
They are controlling with each other or with their children in the same ways their<br/>
parents were controlling.<br/>
      "As parents," I say to them, "it is your responsibility to learn how to make<br/>
yourselves happy so you can be role models for your children. How can your children<br/>
learn how to take emotional responsibility if you don't? Right now, you are role<br/>
modeling being a victim of your circumstances instead of being an emotionally<br/>
responsible adult. You are using your anger, upsets and unhappiness to control your<br/>
 children, or you are putting yourself aside to take care of everyone but yourself. How<br/>
can they learn to take care of themselves if you are not taking care of yourselves?"<br/>
     Many parents take care of externals: they keep the house clean, they are on time,<br/>
they pay their bills, and they earn money. Some parents even take care of their<br/>
physical health by eating well and getting enough exercise. But many parents fail to<br/>
take care of their emotional wellbeing.<br/>
     Taking care of your emotional wellbeing means that you recognize that you cause<br/>
your own feelings with your thoughts and actions. When you think and behave in ways<br/>
that are unloving to yourself or others -- that are not in your highest good --you will<br/>
be unhappy. When you think and behave in ways that are loving to yourself and<br/>
others- that are in your highest good -- you will be happy. Your positive or<br/>
negative emotions are completely the result of your own thoughts and actions.<br/>
      If you operate from the belief that how your children act, or how your parmer<br/>
acts, or how your external life is, causes your feelings, then you are operating as a<br/>
victim. As a victim, your happiness is dependent upon others doing what you want<br/>
them to do and on getting the outcomes you want. If this is your belief system, then<br/>
you are teaching your children to be victims.<br/>
     Taking emotional responsibility means staying tuned into your own feelings and<br/>
immediately shifting your thought process and actions when you are feeling negative<br/>
feelings. It means that you learn to access a spiritual source of inner guidance to help<br/>
you know how to take loving care of yourself. You need to learn to turn to your<br/>
spiritual guidance to help you think the thoughts and take the actions that are tree and in<br/>
harmony with your soul, rather than operating from the false beliefs that cause you pain.<br/>
     Do not kid yourself into thinking that as long as you are there for your children<br/>
you are being good parents. You also need to learn to be there for yourself so that you<br/>
can be a happy and peaceful parent.<br/>
做个快乐的家长<br/>
    当你渐渐长大，你可曾希望过你的父母要活得开心?当他们幸福安宁的时<br/>
候，你是否也感到安全一些呢?<br/>
    我的母亲是一个很少快乐的人。大部分时间，她都是感到焦虑、生气而且感<br/>
到负担过多，尽管我是她惟一的孩子。她很少笑，经常生我或是父亲的气。显<br/>
然，她把自己快乐的责任推给了我俩，而我们总是感到欠她的。<br/>
    我宁愿倾我所有来换取一个快乐的母亲——一个懂得如何为自己的快乐和痛<br/>
苦负责的母亲。我宁愿有一位这样的母亲：她会教给我如何关爱自己，而不是教<br/>
给我怎样做一个不快乐的殉情者。<br/>
    通常，当有家长来向我咨询时，我会问他们是否快乐。而他们往往都说“不<br/>
快乐”。我问他们是否想要他们的父母开心起来，而他们的回答总是一成不变的<br/>
“是的。我宁愿那样。”然而，同为父母，他们自己现在就不快乐。他们表现的就<br/>
如同他们的父母一样——焦虑、生气、沮丧、孤独、抗拒或顺从。他们把自己的<br/>
感情交给另一半或子女来掌控，这正是他们的父母把握自己的情绪的方法。<br/>
    我对他们说：作为家长，你们有责任学会如何让自己开心起来，这样，你们<br/>
才能为子女做出榜样。如果你们都不能主宰自己的感情的话，那你们的孩子又怎<br/>
能做到呢?现在，你们正身体力行地为演示如何做一个环境的牺牲者，而不是在<br/>
示范如何做一个主宰自己感情的大人。你们正利用你们的愤怒、心烦意乱和忧愁<br/>
来控制着你们的孩子，或者你置自己于不顾，而去照顾每一个家人。可是，如果<br/>
你都不好好照顾自己，他们又怎能学会照料自己呢?</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
