  《现代商务英语综合教程:第1册》从培养目标上看，商务英语课程的教学目的不仅仅是了解有关领域的基本知识，更重要的是能够灵活运用英语进行有效的商务沟通，处理国际商务中的实际问题。这种变化和概念的更新给商务英语教学在内容和质量上都提出了更高的要求，这是传统的大学英语教学所不能达到的。教育部《关于外语专业面向21世纪本科教育改革的若干意见》中也明确指出：“从根本上来讲，外语是一种技能，一种载体；只有当外语与某一被载体相结合，才能形成专业。过去常见的是外语与文学、外语与语言学的结合。应该看到，即使在社会主义市场经济的条件下，我国高校仍肩负着为国家培养外国语言文学学科领域的研究人员的任务。</p>]<p><h2>相关资料</h2></p>[<p>
  插图：[2] The first story is about connecting the dots[3] My second story is about love and loss.[4] I was lucky-I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Applein my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garagein to a $2 billion company with over 4,000employees. We had just released our finest creation——the Macintosh-a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started？ Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well.But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of  Directorssided with him. So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.[5] I really didn't know what to dofor a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneursdown- that I had dropped the baton asit was being passed to me. I met withDavid Packard and Bob Noyce and tried toapologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thoughtabout running away from the valley. Butsomething slowly began to dawn on me——Istill loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I hadbeen rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.[6] I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successfulwas replaced by the lightness of being abeginner again, less sure about everything.It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.[7] During the next five years, Istarted a company named NEXT, anothercompany named Pixar, and fell in love withan amazing woman who would becomemy wife. Pixar went on to create theworld's first computer animated featurefilm, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.In a remarkable turn of events, Applebought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at theheart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful familytogether.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
