benedetto croce says, “all history is contemporary history.”
writing today’s history is never easy. nonetheless, we should face
the challenge and seek lessons from contemporary history in order
to be better prepared and to move forward towards the future.
this book records the author wei jianguo’s doings, experiences and
thoughts in the 37 years from 1972 to 2008. through jianguo’s
memoir, readers see africa’s spectacular natural landscape,
understand its pristine customs and traditions, learn of its rich
history and geography, and become aware of numerous touching
stories.
based on his work experience, wei jianguo has extended his
perspective to the entire history of new china’s economic and trade
relations with africa from a unique point of view, with rich
contents and in a straightforward style. like a friendship envoy
shuttling between the past and the present, he leads us to
appreciate the skills of our colleagues working arduously in
africa, to see the profound friendship between the chinese and
african peoples, and to see the far-reaching significance of 60
years of remarkable achievements in comprehensive friendly
sino-african cooperation.
