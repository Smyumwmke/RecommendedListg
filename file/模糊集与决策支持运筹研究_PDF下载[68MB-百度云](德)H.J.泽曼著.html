                                            fuzzy sets and operations research for decision
support is a congratulatory volume of key selected papers by
hans-jurgen zimmermann on the occasion of professor zimmermann's
retirement. this edited-volume is designed as a natural
continuation of the previous two dedicated volumes operations
research (edited by b. werners and r. gabriel, springer, 1994 to
hansjiirgen zimmermann for his 60th birthday) and fuzzy logic
foundations and industrial applications (edited by d. ruan,kluwer
academic, 1996 to hans-jurgen zimmermann for 25 years of
contribution to fuzzy logic theory and applications).the previous
two volumes, captured the essence of professor zimmermann's
enormous contributions to each of these areas,have proved to be
great utility to anyone interested in operations research, fuzzy
sets, and related applications.                                    </p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
