    professor zheng fang is working in
chemistry&amp;chemical engineedng college。central south
univemity．he is an advisor for dog,or s degree studenls．in
1978，fang puraued graduate studies at the central south university
of technology。where he completed his ph。d．his thesis advisor was
xinmin chen。a famous chemist of_{physical chemistw for process
metallurgy． jpon graduation，fang was appointed instructor in
chemistry and rose to the rank of professor in l 991．he was dunn9 1
993 to serve as the researcher to study foam extraction of the rare
metal in the chemistry department of the manitoba university in
canada．when homed。he served as the chief librarian of the
university until 2005．he began to study on the
thermoelectrochemistry (tec)at his early time．from l 993 through
now，except teaching of the courses such as
physicochemistry．mhermodymu'nios of electrolyte solution and
thermodynamics for metallurgical processes for undergraduate and
graduate students。fang has taken his time to supervise and complete
several reseamh subjects supported by the national natural science
foundation of china．
