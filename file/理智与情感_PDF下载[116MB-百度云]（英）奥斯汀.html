She declared them to be very agreeablegirls indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiasticadmiration. Sir John's confidence in his own judgmentrose with this animated praise, and he set off directlyfor the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the MissSteeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being thesweetest girls in the world...When their promised visit to the park andconsequent introduction to these young ladies tookplace, they found in the appearance of the eldest,who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not asensible face, nothing to admire; but in the other,who was not more than two or three and twenty, theyacknowledged considerable beauty; her features werepretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartnessof air, which though it did not give actual elegance orgrace, gave distinction to her person.——Their mannerswere particularly civil, and Elinor soon allowed themcredit for some kind of sense, when she saw with whatconstant and judicious attentions they were makingthemselves agreeable to Lady Middleton. With herchildren they were in continual raptures, extollingtheir beauty, courting their notice, and humouringtheir whims; and such of their time as could be sparedfrom the importunate demands which this politenessmade on it, was spent in admiration of whatever herladyship was doing</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>简介
