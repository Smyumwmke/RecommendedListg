　　now available in english for the first time， physics and
partial differential equations， volumel bridges physics and applied
mathematics in a manner that is easily accessible to readers with
an undergraduate-level background in these disciplines.
　　readers who are more familiar with mathematics than physics will
discover the connection between various physical and mechanical
disciplines and their related mathematical models， which are
described by partial differential equations （pdes）. the authors
establish the funda-mental equations for fields such as
　　electrodynamics;
　　fluid dynamics， magnetohydrodynamics， and reacting fluid
dynamics;
　　elastic， thermoelastic， and viscoelastic mechanics;
　　the kinetic theory of gases;
　　special relativity; and quantum mechanics.
　　readers who are more familiar with physics than mathematics will
benefit from in-depth explanations of how pdes work as effective
mathematical tools to more clearly express and present the basic
concepts of physics. the book describes the mathematical structures
and features of these pdes， including
　　the types and basic characteristics of the equations，
　　the behavior of solutions， and
　　some commonly used approaches to solving pdes.

published in july 1997， and the second volume was published in june
2000. in july 2000， upon the readers' request， we corrected several
typographical errors and republished the first volume.
　　in this edition， minor typographical errors are corrected， and a
small paragraph has been added to section 5.5.4 in chapter 5， while
the remaining text is unchanged.
　　we would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere
thanks to our teachers，friends， and readers for their encouragement
and support.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　Tatsien Li is a Professor in the School of Mathematical
