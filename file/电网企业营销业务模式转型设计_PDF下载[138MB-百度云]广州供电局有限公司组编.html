新一轮的电力体制改革是以市场化为导向，聚焦还原电力产品的商品属性，将有序放开输配环节以外的竞争性环节电价，有序向社会资本放开配售电业务。在售电环节，市场的竞争性和产品的同质性矛盾，要求售电企业必须重视产品品牌化和服务差异化建设。对电网企业而言，要想在售电侧市场放开的过程中获得先发优势，就必须重视并解决这一问题。本书是对电网企业营销业务模式转型的有效尝试，包含4章，第1章是概述，探讨电网企业所处的外部环境，能源消费者需求的变化，分析电网企业营销业务转型的方向；第2章探讨电网企业营销业务转型的方法和思路；第3章是对电网企业营销业务模式转型设计的探索与实践，从管理模式和业务模式两个阶段来梳理营销业务模式转型的思路；第4章则为电网企业的营销业务模式转型进行总结和展望。
