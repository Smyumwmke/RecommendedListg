It contains 203 reports, speeches, remarks, articles, letters, comments, orders and messages, many of which are available in English for the first time. The Selected Works of Jiang Zemin vividly records the historic process in which the third generation of the central collective leadership of the Communist Party of China （CPC）, with Jiang Zemin at its core, guided the Party and the people of all China's ethnic groups in pushing forward socialism with Chinese characteristics. The three volumes accurately review the CPC's valuable experiences of leading the people in overcoming difficulties and initiating a new phase in socialism with Chinese characteristics. They fully reflect the major theoretical achievements the CPC creatively advanced by integrating the basic tenets of Marxism with China's realities and the characteristics of the times under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory. The Selected Works of Jiang Zemin also provides profound insight into the historic process of the inception, formation and development of the important thought of Three Represents, the author's most important theoretical contribution.This volume includes 81 works written between August 21, 1980 and August 5, 1997.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
