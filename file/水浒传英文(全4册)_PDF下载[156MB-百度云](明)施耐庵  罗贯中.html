Around the outside of the wall were two or three hundred big willows. Wang Jin knocked on the gate a long time. Finally, a vassal came out. The arms instructor set down his load and greeted him.　　"What do you want?" the man asked.　　"To tell you the truth," said Wang Jin, "my mother and I tried to cover too much ground and we passed an inn. There doesn't seem to be any inns or villages around here. We hope you can put us up for the night. We'Illeave tomorrow moming. We'd be glad to pay whatever is customary for lodgings. Please let us impose on your kindness."　　"Wait a bit," said the vassal. "I'll ask the squire,If he agrees, you can come in."　　"Sorry to trouble you, brother."　　Before long the man returned and said: "My master bids you both to enter."　　Wang Jin helped his mother dismount. Carrying his shoulderpole and leading the horse, he followed the vassal to a threshing-ground. There he set down his burden and tied the horse to a willow tree. Mother and son went to a hall roofed with thatch. The squire was waiting for them.　　He was a man over sixty. His hair and beard were white. He wore a hood and a straight-cut loose-fitting gown, tied at the waist by a black silk sash. His feet were shod in tanned leather boots.　　Wang Jin kowtowed respectfully.　　"That's not necessary," the old man said hastily."You're travellers who've been exposed to the elements.Please be seated."　　Mother and son completed their ceremonial greetings and sat down.　　"Where are you from?" asked the squire. "Why have you come here so late in the day?"　　"Your humble servant is called Zhang," said Wang Jin.　　"We livein the capital. Because we've used up our money and cannot carry on our business, we're going to Yanan Prefecture to join some relatives. On the road today we were too eager to press on, and passed an inn without noticing it. If you'll permit us to spend the night here we'll leave in the morning and pay whatever is customary for accommodations."　　"Certainly. Who carries his lodgings with him when he travels? I don't suppose you and your mother have eaten?" The squire told his vassal to bring food.　　Soon a table was set up in the hall and the vassal came in with a tray bearing four vegetable dishes and one of beef. He set these on the table and heated some wine which he served first.　　"Our fare is crude here in the country," said the squire.　　"I hope you'll forgive us."　　Wang Jin rose and thanked him. "We're putting you to too much trouble. We don't know how to repay you."　　"No need to talk like that:' said the squire. "Let us drink."　　In response to his urging Wang Jin and his mother downed six or seven cups of wine.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　China's great classic novel Outlaws of the Marsh，written in the fourteenth century，is a fictional account of twelfth-century events during the Song Dynasty.One by one，over a hundred men and women are forced by the harsh feudal officialdom to take to the hills.They band together and defeat every attempt of the government troops to crush them.Within this framework we find intrigue，adventure，murder，warfare，romance…in a connected series of fascinating individual tales，told in the suspenseful manner of the traditional storyteller.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
