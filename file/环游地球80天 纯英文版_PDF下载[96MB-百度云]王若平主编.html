There was no answer， so he called again.Passepartout appeared.　　“I've called you twice，” observed his master.　　“But it's not midnight，” replied the other.　　“I know； I don't blame you. We start for Doverand Calais in ten minutes.”　　“Monsieur is going to leave home?”　　“Yes，” replied Phineas Fogg. “We are going around the world.”　　Passepart，out was astonished. “Round the world!”he said quietiy.　　“In eighty days，” said Mr. Fogg. “So we haven't a moment to lose. We'll only take a bag with some clothes. We'll buy clothes on our way. Bring me my raincoat and some good shoes.”　　Passepartout tried to reply， but couldn't. He made the preparations. Around the world in eightydays! Was his master a fool? No. Was this a joke?They were going to Calais； good! Passepartout had not returned to France for five years. He would be happy to see it again.　　At eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the bag. Mr. Fogg was ready. Under his arm he had a copy of Bradshaw's Continental Railway Steam Transit and General Guide， which had timetables of steamers and railways.　　“Have you forgotten anything?” he asked.　　“Nothing， monsieur.”　　“Good! Take this bag. Take good care of it， for there are twenty thousand pounds in it.”　　They took a cab to the railway station. Before they entered the station， a beggar woman with a child approached and asked for some money.　　Mr. Fogg took the forty pounds he had won at whist， and gave them to the beggar. “Here， my good　　woman. I'm glad I met you.”　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>本书是法国作家儒勒·凡尔纳创作的长篇小说, 是其代表作之一。小说起因于英国绅士福克与朋友打的一个赌: 要在80天内环游地球一周回到伦敦。随后, 他与仆人克服了路途中的艰难险阻, 路经地中海、红海、印度洋、太平洋、大西洋, 游历印度、新加坡、日本、美国等地, *后返回伦敦, 一路上福克机智、勇敢, 表现出十足的绅士派头。作者在介绍各地的风土人情和地理知识的同时, 还以强烈的正义感和人道主义精神, 对各种野蛮、落后、愚昧的社会现状进行了批判和鞭挞。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
