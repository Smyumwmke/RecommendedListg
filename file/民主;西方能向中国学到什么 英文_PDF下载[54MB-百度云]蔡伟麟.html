《民主(西方能向中国学到什么)(英文版)》由蔡伟麟所著。
　　this book provides an in-depth evidence-based analysis on the issue of democracy and good governance, using hundreds of actual examples comparing the chinese and western political systems based on theories, structure, processes and performance. the current chinese political system is designed for wide-based consultation with socialism as its core value whilst avoiding the flaws inherent in the design, process and structure of the western political model. despite the democratic nature of chinese politics that persistently attracts a very high level of citizen satisfaction in each and every public opinion survey when compared to any western democracy, the western media has successfully brainwashed the world into believing that the communist government in china is an autocratic regime. in reality, western democracies are in serious trouble, facing an unprecedented level of debt, unemployment, political cor ruption in the form of political donations, advertising and lobbying, and social dis satisfaction. it is the western political system that requires urgent reform, or risks a revolution from the 99%--its people--in the foreseeable future. therefore, it is time to have a look at the merits of the chinese model.
