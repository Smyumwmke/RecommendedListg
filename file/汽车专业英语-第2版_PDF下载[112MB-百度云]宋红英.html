Theshaft is made integral with its cams and bearing journals.Each cam controls a single valve, either intake or exhaust. Insome automobile engines, the camshaft is made integral withfuel pump eccentric wheel and oil pump drive gear. Thecamshaft bearings are lubricated with oil supplied under pres-sure from the main gallery in the cylinder block.  The tappets serve to transmit the force from the camshaftto the push rods. The tappets are small cylindrical bores re-ceiving the push rods.  They are made of cast iron or steeland located in the guides, which may be made integral withthe cylinder block or removable as in the engine. When theengines operate, the tappets continuously rotate about theiraxes for uniform wear. The rotation is ensured by a convexsurface of their bottoms and a slanted surface of the cams. The push rods transmit the force from the tappets to the rocker. They usually have small con-vex balls inserted on each of their ends. These convex bails fit into the tappet and rocker arm toallow proper movement. Overhead camshafts do not need the push rod. Rocker arms are designed to change the direction of the cam lifting force and provide a cer-tain mechanical advantage during valve lifting.  The purpose of the mechanical advantage is toopen the valve more than the actual lift of the camshaft lobe, which can be done by changing thedistance from the pivot point to the end of the rocker ann. There is the valve clearance betweenthe rocker contact pad and the valve stem tip, so that the valve will be tightly pressed against itsseat when hot. The clearance can be adjusted by adjusting screw of the rocker arm. Each cylinder of a four-stroke-cycle diesel or gasoline engine is commonly equipped with anintake valve a</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
