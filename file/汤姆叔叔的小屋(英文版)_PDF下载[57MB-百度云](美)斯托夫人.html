There were no servants present, and the gentlemen, with chairs closely approaching, seemed to be discussing some subject with great earnestness.For convenience sake, we have said, hitherto, two gentlemen. One of the parties, however, when critically examined, did not seem, strictly speaking, to come under the species. He was a short, thickset man, with coarse, commonplace features, and that swaggering air of pretension, which marks a low man who is trying to elbow his way upward in the world作者简介：Harriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896) was an American author and abolitionist, whose novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852) attacked the cruelty of slavery; it reached millions as a novel and play, and became influential in the U.S. and Britain. It made the political issues of the 1850s regarding slavery tangible to millions, energizing anti-slavery forces in the American North. It angered and embittered the South. The impact is summed up in a commonly quoted statement apocryphally attributed to Abraham Lincoln. When he met Stowe, it is claimed that he said, "So you're the little woman who wrote the book that made this great war!"</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
《汤姆叔叔的小屋(英文版)》运用穿插叙述的手段，通过逆来顺受的汤姆和勇于反抗的伊莉莎两条平行线索，生动再现了美国黑人在南方种植园主的盘剥下的悲惨遭遇。汤姆和伊利莎都是好心的谢比尔家的奴隶，谢比尔的儿子乔治尤其喜爱这位汤姆叔叔，常常到小木屋中写字画画。但谢比尔经营失败，不得不将汤姆和伊莉莎五岁的儿子哈利卖给奴隶贩子黑利。伊莉莎为女主人的贴身女仆，听到噩耗连夜带着儿子渡过刚刚解冻的河水，逃到北方。后来丈夫也化装成贵族，逃出魔掌。汤姆的新主人也是个好心人，然而不久主人去世，他落在红河岸边一个粗暴、残忍的家伙路格里手中，庄园上的黑人每天在皮鞭下拼命苦干，过着非人的生活。处于正义，汤姆协助两名女奴逃走，而他自己却留下来，一次次遭受毒打。就在小乔治赶来看望这位善良的汤姆叔叔时，汤姆已奄奄一息。小乔治长大后去法国留学，毕业后去了非洲，立志建立一个非洲人自己的国家。 此书对19世纪中期的废奴运动产生巨大的推动作用。据说，林肯总统曾称斯托夫人为“写了一本书，却酿成了一场大战的女人。”1. 作者以细腻、朴实的文风写出了黑人奴隶在美国南方旧庄园经济体制下悲惨的生活境遇，更表达了人权思想以及深厚的人道主义精神，从而在美国社会中引起一场深刻的变革，被林肯总统称为“引起一场战争的女人”。2. 《汤姆叔叔的小屋》语言生动、简洁，一直被奉为美国文学中的典范之作，经常被其他族裔的人当做学习英语的入门书。3. 《汤姆叔叔的小屋》在文学上获得较高的成就。《汤姆叔叔的小屋》在美国以及其他各国销售量一直很高，也是被改编为儿童故事、戏剧、电影等文艺形式*多的作品之一。
