When fluidization was first employed industrially，
e．g．，in the Winkler gasifjer，we had only the bubbling
nuidized bed as shown in the middle diagram 0f the
figure，in which gas bypasses as bubbles，thUS leading
t0 poor SOlid—gas contact and incurring large pressure
drop．What is ideal is the high dispersion Of SOlids
shown as the background of the b00k jacket．Short 0f
SUCh an ideal state，we may resort t0 suppressing bubbles
by the use Of shallOw fluidized bed as shown on the
lefthand side diagram achieved through redUCing the
SOlid content Of the fludized bed．or the fast nuidized
bed with continuous recyc“ng 0f SO“ds t0 the bOttom
Of the bed，as shown on the righthand side diagram．All
these diagrams 0f nuidization were generated through
computer mode“ng by Professor Wei Ge，and from
hOSts 0fthese diagrams，four were selected by Xue Bai，
Jianxing Lu and Ying Ren tO portray the principal thesis

1 943 and researched in fluidization under the late Professor
Richard WIlhelm at Princeton UniVeTSitv from 1945 t0
1947．He has continued wotking in this field both in the
United States and in China，and is now Professor and
Director Emetitus of the Institute of Process Eng4neeririg of
the Chino．．se Academy 0f Scienccs。to which he was elected
Member in 1980．In 1989 he reccived an International
Fluidization Award 0f Achievement at the Sixth Interna—
tional Fluidization Confefence held in Banff，Canada．
    The author postulates an idea“zed system of complete
homogeneity that can be used in the 8．nalysis of many engineeting problems，e．g．，
    ·  generalized fl uidization with both solids and fluid in flow
    ·fluidized leaching and washing
    ·SOlids mixing and segregation
    ·operation of conical fluidized beds
    These problems  arise  in  hydtaulic  classification  according  to particle  size  and
den$itv，sedimentation and classification，continuous ion exchange or adsorption，water
treatment，fluid—bed electrolysis，and biochemical processes involving granular particles
and  supercritical  extraction  of  solid  materials．  Professor  Kwauk  also  expounds
alternative bubbleless gas—SOlid contacting systems，e．g．，d讣ute raining particles，fast
fluidization，  shallow  fluidized  beds，  and particles  fluidized  under  the  influence  of
oscillating  flow--some  of  these techniques  are  already  replacing  their  bubbling
predecessors．  He proposes further a method for assessing the fluidizing performance of
powdeTS with a view to improving their gas-sohd contacting behavior in the direction of
the idea“zed state through particle design．
Youchu Li graduated from Tianjin University in 1 962 and
was appointed to the Institute of Chemical Metallurgy(now
Process Engineeting)of the Chinese Academy of Sciences．
He is now a retired professor．  As a researcher and director
of the Fluidization Laboratory，he developed correlations for
the dynamics of fast fluidization，multi—layer fluidized bed，
gas—SOlid mixing，mass and heat transfer in fluidization，and
he developed processes  for magnetizing roasting of low-
grade and complex iron ores。  calcination of non-metaUic
ores，clean coal combustion and pyrolysis and preparation 0f
various powdered functional materials．
    Professor Li received several awards from the State and the Chinese Academy of
Scieaces，and he summaTized in 2008 his more than 40 years’R&amp;D in fluidization in a
monograph，“Introduction t0 Fluidization Process Engineering’’(in Chinese)．  In the
present pub“cation，he contributed two addenda：one on recent studies on gas-solid flOW
and applicatious of fast fluidization and the other on the more recent area of</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
