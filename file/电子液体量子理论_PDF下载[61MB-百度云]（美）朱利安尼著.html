of most of our current understanding of the physical properties of
electronic systems. quite remarkably, the latter are nowadays at
the intersection of the most exciting areas of science: materials
science, quantum chem- istry, nano-electronics, biology, and
quantum computation. accordingly, its importance can hardly be
overestimated. the field is particularly attractive not only for
the simplicity of its classic formulation, but also because, by its
very nature, it is still possible for individual researchers, armed
with thoughtfulness and dedication, and surrounded by a small group
of collaborators, to make deep contributions, in the best tradition
of "small science".</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
