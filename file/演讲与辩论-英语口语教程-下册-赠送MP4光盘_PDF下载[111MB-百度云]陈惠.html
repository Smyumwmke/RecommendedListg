  《英语口语教程:下册(演讲与辩论)》内容简介：理念吸纳与采用“输出驱动假设”理论，强调输入与输出相结合；突破传统的英语口语教材进行单一口语教学的模式，将口语教学作为一个系统工程来进行立体建构。内容上册“基本技能训练”由18个单元组成，每个单元分为四大部分。**部分热身训练，主要是从模仿入手，培养学生纯正的语音语调；第二部分情景对话，注重交际功能的训练，选材与社会发展、学生生活紧密相联；第三部分是与主题有关的拓展性课堂活动；第四部分为学生提供了课后阅读和背诵材料，以增加学生在英美文化和知识方面的积淀，从而提高英语口头表达语言的准确性和对文化差异的敏感性。下册由演讲与辩论两大部分组成。演讲部分将名人演讲和学生模仿训练相结合，将特殊情景下的演讲和普遍性演讲知识与技能学习相结合，使学生从模仿式的口语产出发展成积极的、创造性的、思辨性的口语产出；辩论部分旨在让学生熟悉一般英语辩论的过程和规则，培养学生的问题意识，提高学生的知识综合能力、批判性倾听能力、快速反应能力以及辨析能力。形式英语知识的学习和英语口语技能的操练交织在一起，有模仿表演、看图说话、故事复述、故事创作、角色演绎、主题演讲、专题辩论等，不同阶段的同类活动在难易程度上和形式上都有所变化。</p>]<p><h2>相关资料</h2></p>[<p>
  插图：Although much larger numbers of invertebrates are used and the use of flies and worms as model organisms is very important, experiments on invertebrates are largely unregulated and not included in statistics. Most animals are euthanized after being used in an experiment. Sources of laboratory animals vary between countries and species; while most animals are purpose-bred, others may be caught in the wild or supplied by dealers who obtain them from auctions and pounds.The research is conducted inside universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, farms, defense establishments, and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. It includes pure research such as genetics, developmental biology, behavioral studies, as well as applied research such as biomedical research, xenotransplantation, drug testing and toxicology tests, including cosmetics testing. Animals are also used for education, breeding, and defense research.The topic is highly controversial. Supporters of the practice, such as the British Royal Society, argue that virtually every medical achievement in the 20th century relied on the use of animals in some way, with the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences arguing that even sophisticated computers are unable to model interactions between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms, and the environment, making animal research necessary in some areas.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
