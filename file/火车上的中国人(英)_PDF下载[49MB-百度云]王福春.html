In the past 40 years, China's economy has developed by leaps and bounds. Railways are like the arteries of the land but also mirror China's economic prosperity. As a railway worker and a photographer Wang Fuchun has always focused his camera on passengers on trains. With near-instinctive observation and empathy, he has recorded their real emotions, sadness, happiness, joys and sorrows, in narrow, long trains. By doing so, he has extended the trains, originally a means of transportation, into a stage of life, a space of historical changes, a platform for socialization, a joyful theater and a moving caravan. This engrossing album condenses people’s lives into fast-moving trains. The photographer Wang Fuchun uses his unique humorous vision and sharp perspective to reflect social progress and human nature in his black and white photos, allowing his audience to join him in this delightful journey. Time flies. When we look back on the past and recall our experiences on the trains in those days while sitting in a clean and comfortable train today, we may have forgotten the pain and those jostling crowds. What remains are warm memories and friends we have made on our many trips.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>王福春，1963年考入哈尔滨铁路局绥化铁路机车司机学校，20世纪80年代就读于哈尔滨师范大学摄影专业，曾任哈尔滨铁路局科研所摄影师、编辑。2002年从哈尔滨迁居北京，现为自由摄影人，任公益摄影协会副主席、全国《光影助学工程》公益形象大使。拍摄有《火车上的中国人》《黑土地》《东北人家》《东北虎》《中国蒸汽机车》《生活中的中国人》等十余部摄影专题，多次赴丹麦、法国、意大利、英国、美国、俄罗斯等国家参加摄影展和画廊展，2012年获国际摄影协会金龙奖终生成就奖。
