Secondly， it is not likely to identify or adequately describe allthe decisional options at each step. Thirdly， the information necessary forrational decision making is often insufficient. These three factors can severelyundermine the validity of the CPA approach. As Segal &amp; Spaeth （2002）point out， all the rationality-based models only represent reality in a　　simplified way and ignore certain aspects of reality. The explanations provided in these models are reductionist in that the context and meaning of judicial behavior are idealized. We can not expect any rational models to address the　　richness and complexity of judicial reality，　　Besides rationality， JJB research also needs to address the irrationality and nonrationality inherent in judges' behavior （Back， 1961） . We need to make allowance for the errors judges commit， the poor analysis judge make and the inappropriate heuristics judges use.That is， the rationality-based CPA shall be complemented with theories that incorporate judges' personal values， thinking patterns， skills and habits as well as the limited information available. Back （1961： 16）  points out that "the rational model derives the decision from the structure of the situation while the irrational model derives it from the tructure of the person".This understanding of JJB has propelled JJB researchers to shift their attention to' the dynamics of the judicial context and the social constraints.　　2.2.2 Sociological Approach to Judicial Behavior　　In modem psychology， as the conduit metaphor of human cognition has become an increasingly less satisfactory model， there emerges a call for a humanistic view of psychology （Fuchs &amp; Milar， 2003） .Similarly，judicial behavior research has found that only verv rare situations can meet the canonical cognitive models. More often than not， judicial behavior is unprogrammed， with no fixed pattems to follow.Judges have to deal with situations which are novel，unstructured and consequential.This observation engendered the sociolegal work （Black， 1997）  in JJB research. Different from the traditional approaches which build their theorizations on cognitive psychology， this sociological approach focuses on the "interactive decisions" （Raiffa， 1994） .It is interested in the real， complex，ill-defined world and aims to account for the differences in the situation， the person and the decision.　　Following this sociological perspective， judicial behavior research shall be rooted in empirical analysis and seek explanations for the actual judicial behaviors of individuals or groups of people by describing them as their personal or institutional life （Back， 1961） .It shall turn to "look at the many and varied practice and behaviors we call 'legal'  and seek， in a somewhat piecemeal way， to build our understanding of law from below in a gradual and accumulative way" （Murphy &amp; Coleman 1990： 35）.In this line， Baum （2006） ， for example， points out that we shall pay attention to judges' response to their audience， for it is primarily judges' desire to be liked and respected that influences their judicial behavior.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>法官决策话语主要有调节类、征询类、表征类和定性类等四种。但每种话语行为都有多种不同的实现形式。这表明，法官行为是结构性与动态性的矛盾统一。从法官认同方面，我们发现，法官这些司法话语行为的差异性可从法官认同的三个层面(即话语性、情景性和转移性)得到解释。基于法官的认同取向，我们发现法官决策行为差异可大体表现在三个方面：首先。法官在司法过程中是以程序为知名品牌还是以实体内容为知名品牌。其次、法官在人际定位上是倾向于型还是友好型。很后、法官在认知取向上是采用范畴化模式还是叙事模式。这些差异不是法官固有角色特征的属性，而是法官在司法过程中存在状态的具体关切体现。基于本研究的分析结果，本文很后提出司法公正是一种话语建构的实体，存在于日常司法话语之中。司法行为的核心是司法过程中法官的关切状态。法官司法行为研究的本质就是揭示由法官认同所体现的法官关切状态。司法改革需要使法官的“纯真”知识合法化。解决这个问题的方法是提高法官的批判性话语意识。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　Zhong Cai-shun  is currently a lecturer in Jiangxi Normal University.
