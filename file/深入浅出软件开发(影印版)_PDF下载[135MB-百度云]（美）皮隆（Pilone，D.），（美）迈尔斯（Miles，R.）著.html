    Intro1 great software development: Pleasing your customer  Tom's Trails is going online  Most projects have two major concerns  The Big Bang approach to development  Flash forward: two weeks later  Big bang development usually ends up in a big MESS  Great sottware development is...  Getting to the goal with ITERATION  Each iteration is a mini-project  Each iteration is QUALITY software  The customer WILL change things up  It's up to you to make adjustments  But there are some BIG problems...  Iteration handles change automatically (well sort ot)  Your software isn't complete until it's been RELEASED  Tools for your Software Development Toolbox2 gathering requirements: Knowing what the customer wants  Orion's Orbits is modernizing  Talk to your customer to get MORE information  Bluesky with your customer  Sometimes your bluesky session looks like this...  Find out what people REALLY do  Your requirements must be CUSTOMER-oriented  Develop your requirements with customer feedback  User stories detine the WHAT of your project...  estimates define the WHEN  Cubicle conversation  Playing Planning Poker  Put assumptions on trial for their lives  A BIG user stoW estimate is a BAD user story estimate  The goal is convergence  The requirement to estimate iteration cycle  Finally, we're ready' to estimate the whole project3 project planning: Planning for success  Customers want their software NOW!  Prioritize with the customer  We know what's in Milestone 1.0 (well, maybe)  If the features don't fit, re-prioritize  More people sometimes means diminishing returns  Work your way to a reasonable milestone 1.0  Iterations should be short and sweet  Comparing your plan to reality  Velocity accounts for overhead in your estimates  Programmers think in UTOPIAN days...  Developers think in REAL-WORLD days...  When is your iteration too long?  Deal with velocity BEFORE you break into iterations  Time to make an evaluation  Managing customers  The Big Board on your wall  How to ruin your team's lives4 user stories and tasks: Getting to the real work  Introducing iSwoon  Do your tasks add up?  Plot just the work you have left  Add your tasks to your board  Start working on your tasks  A task is only in progress when it's IN PROGRESS  What if I'm working on two things at once?  Your first standup meeting...  Task 1 : Create the Date class  Standup meeting: Day 5, end of Week 1...  Standup meeting: Day 2, Week 2...  We interrupt this chapter...  You have to track unplanned tasks  Unexpected tasks raise your burn-dovm rate  Velocity helps, but...  We have a lot to do...  ...but we know EXAC, TLY where we stand  Velocity Exposed5 good-enough design: Getting it done with great design  iSwoon is in serious trouble...  This design breaks the single responsibility principle  Spotting multiple responsibilies in your design  Going from multiple responsibilies to a single responsibility  Your design should obey the SRP, but also be DRY...  The post-refactoring standup meeting...  Unplanned tasks are still just tasks  Part of your task is the demo itself  When everything's complete, the iteration's done  6 version control: Defensive development  You've got a new contract  BeatBox Pro  And now the GUI work...  Demo the new BeatBox for the customer  Let's start with VERSION CONTROL  First set up your project...  ...then you can check code in and out.  Most version control tools will try and solve problems for you  The server tries to MERGE your changes  If your software can't merge the changes, it issues a conflict  More iterations, more stories...  We have more than one version of our software...
