And for the next ten minutes Tom bought more and more tickets， some blue， some red， from other boys he met at the door. Children were given tickets for learning Bible sentences. Blue meant that two sentences had been learned， red meant twenty， and yellow meant two hundred. If a student had ten yellow tickets， he would win a Bible. It was a great honor to win this. Although Tom didn't really care about having a new Bible， he loved the idea of being the only student to get it.　　At the beginning of class the teacher told the children to be good， sit up straight， and listen carefully. Tom noticed three men and a woman enter the classroom while the teacher was talking. The woman had a child with her. It was the new girl whom he had seen the other day. He wanted her to see him， so he started to hit and play with his friends sitting near him.　　The teacher asked the five new people to come to the front of the class and then introduced them to the students. Everyone knew the first man， Mr. Thatcher， because he was from the same village， but the other gentleman was his brother， Judge Thatcher. He had just moved to this village with his family and he was a very interesting man who had traveled to many different parts of the world.　　That day， in order to impress Judge Thatcher， the teacher hoped a student would come to class with ten yellow tickets. But， of course， this was not something that happened often. He didn't really expect this to happen； he just hoped he might be lucky. Looking around the room， he saw that none of the students had enough tickets. He became disappointed. But then Tom Sawyer approached him holding nine yellow tickets， nine red tickets， and ten blue tickets. The teacher's dream had come true And it was even more surprising that it was Tom Sawyer who had them.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>《汤姆·索亚历险记》描写了以汤姆·索亚为首的一群孩子天真烂漫的生活。这部作品自问世以来，一直受到美国广大读者的喜爱，被誉为“真正的儿童小说，不朽的儿童读物”。幼年丧母的汤姆，由姨妈抚养，由于受不了姨妈和学校老师的管束，常常逃学闯祸。一天深夜，他与好友哈克贝利·费恩竟跑到凄凉的墓地玩耍，他们躲在三棵大树的后面，却目睹了一起凶杀案的发生。因为怕被凶手灭口，他们带着另一个小伙伴逃到一座荒岛，做起了“海盗”。家里本以为孩子们淹死了，结果他们却出现在了自己的“葬礼”上。经过激烈的思想斗争，汤姆终于勇敢地站出来指证了凶手。不久，他和他心爱的姑娘贝基外出野餐，在岩洞里迷了路。整整三天三夜饥寒交困，面临着死亡的威胁。后来终于成功脱险，意外地和哈克一起找到了凶手埋藏的一笔宝藏。马克·吐温的作品对后来的美国文学产生了深远的影响，被认可为美国文学目前的里程碑，而他本人更被誉为“美国文学中的林肯”。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　马克·吐温（Mark Twain，1835-1910），原名塞缪尔·朗霍恩·克莱门斯，生于美国密苏里州佛罗里达，先后当过印刷所学徒、报童、排字工人、水手、轮船驾驶员和报馆记者等，四处奔波，经历丰富。1865年，他发表了成名作《卡拉韦拉斯县声名狼藉的跳蛙》，一生笔耕不辍。著有长篇小说《汤姆·索亚历险记》《赫克贝利·芬恩历险记》《王子与贫儿》以及中短篇小说《百万英镑》《败坏了哈德莱堡名声的人》《竞选州长》等。他是美国文学史上用纯粹的美国口语进行写作的作家，开创了一代文风。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
