  It actually happens that some States have never adopted legislation to implementthe convention they ratified; or have not properly published it in their OfficialGazettes; or that the definition of the crime in the national legislation is incomplete;or that the obligation of universal jurisdiction is missing ; etc. Usually, other Statesparties to these conventions will not care enough so as to have each one of themcorrectly adjusted its legislation to the crime defined in the convention.It can be different only with the stipulations in these conventions of a contractualcharacter providing various kinds of mutual legal assistance, including extradition. Ifone State party refused to comply with a lawful request by another party in thesedomains, it can expect reciprocal practice.  However,  the conventions codifyinguniversally recognized international crimes are as yet scarce of the obligations of thiskind.On the other hand, States are free to incriminate in their national laws whateverinternational and transnational crimes they wish,  even beyond their obligationsassumed by treaties. Usually these lists are in national criminal laws more abundantthan the crimes which are in competence of international criminal courts andtribunals.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
